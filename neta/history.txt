Figuring out what can be used in the framework
Playing https://ramirezmike2.itch.io/usa-football-league-scouting-combine-xlv (winner of Bevy Jam #2 : https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2/results)
    finding out it's quite slow...
    returning to old days of internet?
Search documentation -https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/?search=bundle
    Looking for "bundle" to see what can be used (such as texts, buttons, etc.)
seems like Bevy doesn't have text input...
    But looking MIDI section on the unofficial cookbook, maybe there's a possibility of 3rd-party extension library? → found bevy_egui! https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui
